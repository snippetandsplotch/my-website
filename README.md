## About the Artist

I am Mansi, someone who perhaps took learning art in school a little too seriously. What began as discipline became devotion; art was never casual, but studied, practiced, and eventually loved. That seriousness built the foundation.

The name Snippet and Splotch does not take itself too seriously, intentionally so. Picking up a brush is about delight, not perfection; about lightness and play. Creation here goes beyond a basic canvas — different surfaces and mediums set Snippet and Splotch apart, with textures, layers, and mixed techniques shaping each story.

The work is not just painted; it is built and explored. Art is expression in its most vivid, radiant, viscerally visual form. It becomes rhythm, instinct, language — simply joy made visible.
